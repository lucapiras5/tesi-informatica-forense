* Packages

Control what software is allowed (DFSG), harmonize software with system (init scripts, create users, etc., risk of breaking things with a manual install), signatures in packages (chain of trust?)

* TUI

Unix (text streams are the universal interface), GUI (usability guidelines for mouse, minimum size for items formula, keyboard navigation and autocompletion, historical TTYs and video of one printing on paper)

* Cathedral/bazaar

Methods in FOSS communities, issues with each (examples of projects)
